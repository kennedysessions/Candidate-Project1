	<div class="introduction">
		<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
		<p> U.S. Rep. <a href="https://kennedyforuscongress.com/issues/"> Timothy M. Kennedy</a> is running for reelection to keep his seat as Democratic congressman for New York’s 26th House District. Kennedy’s bid comes months after winning <a href="https://apnews.com/article/special-election-congress-new-york-kennedy-dickson-e7b6956b577c63109491ccf805f0bc81"> a special election</a> in May, replacing former Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY), who retired earlier this year. The Western New York Democrat district includes Buffalo and parts of Niagara Falls. Before his short stint in Congress, Kennedy served as a New York State Senator from 2011 to 2024. Here’s what to know about Kennedy’s policy positions. </p>
</div>
		
<div class="policy">
		<h2>Abortion and Reproductive Rights</h2>
		<p> Kennedy has said he’s committed to supporting a bill to codify Roe v. Wade’s protections into law if the legislation came to a vote on the House floor. Similarly, Kennedy voted to protect abortion protections under NY law while he was a state senator. A move that caused him to lose support with anti-abortion groups that once backed his campaign and received pushback from members of his delegation within the Catholic church. Kennedy has acknowledged his stance on abortion has “evolved” throughout his time in politics. He previously told <a href= "https://buffalonews.com/news/local/kennedy-s-evolution-to-pro-choice-stance-earns-praise-criticism/article_143fa98f-72f0-5c3d-86ba-65ee8b00e74c.html">Buffalo News</a>, “At the end of the day that, a woman has to be able to make a decision upon her health, her life, and her family that is in her best interests and their best interests.” </p>
	</div>

<div class="policy">
	<h3>The economy</h3>
	<p>Kennedy has voiced support for working families and vowed to stop legislation aimed at union-busting or repealing labor protections. As a state senator in 2013, he rallied to <a href= "https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2013/timothy-m-kennedy/senator-kennedy-announces-minimum-wage-increasing"> increase the New York State minimum wage</a> and eventually co-sponsored legislation to raise it to $9 an hour. Kennedy has also pledged to “fight inflation” and “empower striking workers.” </p>

<div class="policy">
<h4>Veteran affairs</h4>
<p> 
	Two months after being sworn into office, Kennedy was appointed to Congress’ Veteran Affairs Committee in July. In a September interview with <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVcn-D0APYE">WIVTB,</a> Kennedy called the veteran affairs hospital in his hometown of Buffalo, NY, a “model” for the rest of the nation but said he aims to address lingering issues in the 1940s-built building, including staffing shortages, technology improvements, and infrastructure.“It’s all about making sure that our veterans are getting the services, the healthcare that they have earned and that they deserve,” Kennedy said.</p>
</div>

<div class="policy">
	<h4>Gun safety</h4>
	<p> Kennedy has said that he’s committed to supporting a federal assault weapons ban and voting to pass other gun safety measures. In 2022, 10 Black people were killed in a targeted shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo. Following the shooting, Kennedy voted for legislation to <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/capital-region/capital-tonight/2022/07/02/buffalo-s-tim-kennedy--extraordinary-session-made-nys--stronger--on-guns-and-human-rights"> change the state’s gun laws,</a>including raising the age to buy a semi-automatic weapon to 21, banning non-law enforcement citizens from buying body armor, mandating a bun license for all semi-automatic weapons, and improving New York State’s “red flag” laws which remove firearms from anyone who may be a danger to themselves or others. </p>
